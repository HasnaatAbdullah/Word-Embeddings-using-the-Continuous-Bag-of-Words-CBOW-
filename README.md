Implementation of Word Embeddings using the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model and applying them to Sentiment Analysis.
# ðŸ§  Word Embeddings with Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)

This project demonstrates how to **train word embeddings from scratch** using the **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)** architecture and leverage them for **sentiment analysis**.  
The model learns vector representations of words that capture semantic and syntactic relationships, which are then used to analyze the sentiment of text data.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Word embeddings are a powerful way to represent words numerically in a high-dimensional vector space.  
Unlike traditional **bag-of-words** approaches, embeddings preserve **semantic relationships** between words.

For example, the trained model learns that:
